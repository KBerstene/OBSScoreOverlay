# OBSScoreOverlay
An Android app for updating score files from my phone on tabletop live streams.

This is a personal project that I built to allow me to update files on a server that could then be read by OBS and overlaid onto a live stream.

This software uses the JCIFS library, licensed under the GNU LGPL v2.1.  The license file can be found in the lib folder with the JCIFS library JAR.
